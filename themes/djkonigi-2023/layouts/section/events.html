      <p>Konigi is an open format DJ and can play a wide range of music based on the event, and also provide sound and lighting services. At corporate parties, galas and private parties I play eclectic sets of pop, dance music, disco, R&amp;B, soul, rock, etc. as the client or venue requests. In bars and clubs I play house music nights.</p> 
      <p>I also DJ a silent disco monthly in the Bay Area, and hosted a monthly DJ meetup in Marin County to showcase DJs. </p>
